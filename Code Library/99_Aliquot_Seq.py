# Numbers which have repeating Aliquot sequence of length 1 are called Perfect Numbers. For example 6, sum of its proper divisors is 6.
# Numbers which have repeating Aliquot sequence of length 2 are called Amicable numbers. For example 220 is a Amicable Number.
# Numbers which have repeating Aliquot sequence of length 3 are called sociable number.

# Aliquot Sequence of a number starts with itself,
# remaining terms of the sequence are sum of proper divisors of immediate previous term.
